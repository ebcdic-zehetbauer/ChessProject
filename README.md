It started with the following prompt in my GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio.
  I am looking at the "Chess Programming WIKI", https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page on building a Chess game engine. 
  I would like to build one using C++23 features. My end goal is to have a chess game engine that can run on both unix and windows. 
  Please ask me three questions on my goal before we start coding.
